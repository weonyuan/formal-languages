Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Incorrect indentation in driver. Please use a two-space indentation.

- Good block comments

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}

- You are using TABs!!!


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.

- The driverDFA.java file is incorrecly named as: DriverDFA.java


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- Next time, include a more meaningful description of the states. What does it
  mean to be in that state, for example.
